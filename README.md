## Problem Description:
The goal of this project is to build, design, and implement a relational database to model the key operations of Spotify's streaming ecosystem. The central entity in our model is the User entity, representing each spotify account holder. Each user may hold a subscription (Free, Student, or Premium), which is linked to billing records for payment tracking. Users can create multiple playlists, each containing songs across various genres and albums. These relationships are modeled to reflect how Spotify's users engage with artists and manage their music libraries. To simplify the database structure, we assume that each playlist is created by a single user, once a user buys a subscription they do not cancel it, each song belongs to exactly one genre, and each album is associated with a single artist. These assumptions allow us to maintain referential integrity and reduce many-to-many relationship complexisty in the model. We are interested in accurately modeling these relationships, generating sample data, and populating the entities and their attributes with this sample data. Furthermore, we plan to perform SQL queries to gain important business insights. These queries will demonstrate how the relational database can support Spotify's data driven decisions regarding marketing and user retention.


## Data Model:

Explanation of our Data Model:
Our data model is based on the structure of a music streaming platform that allows users to listen to songs, create playlists, and manage subscriptions. The goal of this design is to capture all the essential entities and their relationships in a system similar to Spotify or Apple Music.

The User entity represents individuals who use the platform. Each user has attributes such as their name, email, date of birth, and the type of subscription they hold. Each user can subscribe to multiple plans, and each subscription plan can be associated with various users. This many-to-many relationship between Users and Subscriptions allows for flexibility. Users may switch or hold multiple active plans (ex, family or student subscriptions), and the same subscription type can be shared among many users. Billing information is linked to both Users and Subscriptions through the Billing entity, which tracks details such as billing amount, date, and payment method.

The Playlist entity is connected to Users in a one-to-many relationship, since each user can create multiple playlists. Each playlist can contain various songs, and each song can appear in various playlists. This many-to-many relationship between Playlist and Songs is represented through the associative table playlistHasSong, which links songs to playlists.

Music data is organized through the Songs, Albums, Genre, Artists, and Label entities. Each Song includes attributes like title, length, and release date, and it belongs to both a specific Album and Genre. Each Album can contain many songs and is connected to one Artist, forming a one-to-many relationship. Genres represent musical categories such as pop, rock, or hip-hop, and each genre can be linked to many songs.

The Artists entity represents performers and songwriters, while Label captures the record companies they are signed with. Each label can have many artists, but each artist belongs to only one label. Since artists often collaborate on songs, the ArtistHasSong associative entity captures the many-to-many relationship between Artists and Songs.

Overall, the model provides a comprehensive structure to store and analyze user behavior, billing history, subscription patterns, and mustic metadata. It allows for meaningful insights into user activity (such as most played genres or playlists), financial performance through billing data, and artist collaboration networks within the music streaming world.
